I am a final year PhD student at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) where I am supervised by [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/) and [Petr Novotný](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xnovot18/). Prior to joining ISTA, I obtained my undergraduate and master degrees in mathematics at the University of Cambridge, where I was a student at the lovely Gonville & Caius College. You can find my CV  [here](CV_Zikelic.pdf).

**I will be joining the School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) at Singapore Management University as an assistant professor in January 2024.**

# Research Interests

My research is concerned with developing algorithms for formally verifying correctness of software. In particular, I combine ideas from **Formal Verification**, **Programming Languages** and **Machine Learning** research towards designing mathematically rigorous yet fully automated and scalable methods for formal analysis of programs, systems with learned components and safe learning. I work in the broad areas of formal verification, program analysis and AI safety.

The central theme of my work is the development of formal methods and automated reasoning techniques for **stochastic systems**, where I am interested in probabilistic program analysis, stochastic control and safe reinforcement learning. However, my research is not restricted to stochastic systems and I also work on static analysis of non-probabilistic programs, other aspects of verification of systems with learned components and on games on graphs.

# Research Highlights

I am especially interested in formal verification and certified control of **stochastic systems** in which stochasticity is used to model and quantify uncertainty. I have worked on static analysis of probabilistic programs ([CAV 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_4), [FM 2021](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-90870-6_33), [POPL 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3009837.3009873)) and formal verification and safe policy learning for stochastic feedback loop systems ([AAAI 2023a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05308), [SRML@ICLR 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11991), [AAAI 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09495), [NeurIPS 2021](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/544defa9fddff50c53b71c43e0da72be-Abstract.html)). However, my research is not restricted to stochastic systems and I have also worked on static analysis for non-probabilistic programs and properties such as termination or resource usage ([PLDI 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3519939.3523435), [PLDI 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453483.3454093)), as well as on verification of quantized neural networks ([AAAI 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16187), [AAAI 2021](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16496)).

I also study bidding games on graphs. These are a class of games that model ongoing and stateful auctions, in which players have budgets and bid for the right to move. In our work, we studied such games with several classical bidding mechanisms ([AAAI 2023c](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13626), [SODA 2021](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611976465.38), [MFCS 2019](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10955/)). -->
