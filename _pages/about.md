I am an (incoming) Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). I will join SMU in January 2024.

Prior to joining SMU, I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2023 at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/) and [Petr Novotný](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xnovot18/). Before that, I obtained undergraduate and master degrees in mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). You can find my CV  [here](CV_Zikelic.pdf).

# Research Interests

My research is concerned with developing formal verification, synthesis and certified learning techniques towards making software and intelligent systems more safe, secure, robust and trustworthy. To do so, I combine ideas and tackle a range of problems from **Formal Methods**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning** and **Programming Languages** research. 

The central theme of my work is the development of formal methods and certified learning techniques for software and intelligent systems in the presence of **uncertainty**. Uncertainty may arise due to a plethora of reasons, including interaction with unknown environments, inference from data, randomization, interleaving of processes or multi-agent systems. My goal is to design methods that take uncertainty into account and allow us to build safe, secure, robust and reliable software and intelligent systems even in the presence of uncertainty.

Automated methods for probabilistic program analysis and for learning-based stochastic control often draw insight from these areas, so I follow the developments and contribute to these fields. Finally, I am also interested in bidding games on graphs.

# Research Highlights

I am especially interested in formal verification and certified control of **stochastic systems** in which stochasticity is used to model and quantify uncertainty. I have worked on static analysis of probabilistic programs ([CAV 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_4), [FM 2021](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-90870-6_33), [POPL 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3009837.3009873)) and formal verification and safe policy learning for stochastic feedback loop systems ([AAAI 2023a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05308), [SRML@ICLR 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11991), [AAAI 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09495), [NeurIPS 2021](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/544defa9fddff50c53b71c43e0da72be-Abstract.html)). However, my research is not restricted to stochastic systems and I have also worked on static analysis for non-probabilistic programs and properties such as termination or resource usage ([PLDI 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3519939.3523435), [PLDI 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453483.3454093)), as well as on verification of quantized neural networks ([AAAI 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16187), [AAAI 2021](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16496)).

I also study bidding games on graphs. These are a class of games that model ongoing and stateful auctions, in which players have budgets and bid for the right to move. In our work, we studied such games with several classical bidding mechanisms ([AAAI 2023c](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13626), [SODA 2021](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611976465.38), [MFCS 2019](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10955/)). -->
