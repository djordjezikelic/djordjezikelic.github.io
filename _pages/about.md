I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). Previously, I obtained my PhD in 2023 at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/) and [Petr Novotn√Ω](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xnovot18/). For my PhD work, I received the Outstanding PhD Thesis and the Outstanding Scientific Achievement awards at ISTA. Before that, I obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).

You can reach me at dzikelic@smu.edu.sg.

# Research Interests

My research is concerned with helping programmers ensure that software and AI systems are correct, safe, and trustworthy. To achieve this, I study **Formal Methods** and their applications to **Program Analysis and Verification**, as well as **Trustworthy AI and Safe Autonomy**. The long term goal of my work is to advance the theory and automation of formal methods for certifying correctness of software and AI systems, especially in the presence of **probabilistic uncertainty**. My work is concerned with both theoretical aspects of formal reasoning about probabilistic systems, as well as the development of automated methods to help programmers build correct software and AI systems in practice. My current research interests include:
1. Program Analysis and Verification

    - Efficient quantifier elimination for template-based synthesis in programs ([AAAI25b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16226), [arXiv24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03796))
2. Trustworthy AI and Safe Autonomy
    - Certified learning-enabled control and safe reinforcement learning ([AAAI25a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12996), [NeurIPS23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yx8Sw2H5Q7), [ATVA23](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-45329-8_17), [TACAS23](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30823-9_1), [AAAI23a](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26407), [AAAI22](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20695))
