I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). Previously, I obtained my PhD in 2023 at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/) and [Petr Novotn√Ω](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xnovot18/). For my PhD work, I received the Outstanding PhD Thesis and the Outstanding Scientific Achievement awards at ISTA. Before that, I obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).

You can reach me at dzikelic@smu.edu.sg.

# Openings

**I have multiple openings for motivated PhD students, interns, and visiting PhD/master/undergrad students, to work with me on topics related to formal methods, trustworthy AI or program analysis. Please see this [page](https://djordjezikelic.github.io/openings/) if interested.**

<!-- **I have multiple openings for motivated PhD students to work with me on topics related to formal methods, trustworthy AI or program analysis. Please apply through our [PhD program](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/phd/online-application) and list me as a potential advisor. You are also welcome to reach out to me directly before applying. Applicants with a degree in computer science, mathematics or related fields are all welcome. I also have openings for research assistants (students at SMU), internships and visiting research students (undergraduate, master and PhD students from other institutions). If you are interested in any of the above positions, feel free to drop me an email with your CV, transcripts and a few sentences about what aspects of my work interest you.**

Singapore is a vibrant and cosmopolitan place with a thriving academic landscape. It is also a perfect place for fellow food lovers. SMU is a premier university and provides an excellent research environment with strong groups in formal methods, AI and software engineering. Doctoral positions at SMU are **fully funded**. See this [page](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/phd/admissions-fees-scholarships) for details. -->

# Research Interests

My research is concerned with helping programmers ensure that software and intelligent systems are correct, safe, and trustworthy. It lies at the intersection of **Formal Methods**, **Artificial Intelligence** and **Programming Languages** research. The long term goal of my research is to advance the theory and automation of **formal methods for trustworthy AI and software**, especially in the presence of **uncertainty**. My work is concerned with both theoretical aspects of formal reasoning under uncertainty, as well as the development of automated methods to help programmers build correct software and AI systems in practice. My current research interests (with references to some recent work) include:
- Safe (stochastic) control and reinforcement learning ([NeurIPS23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yx8Sw2H5Q7), [TACAS23](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30823-9_1), [AAAI23](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26407), [AAAI22](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20695))
