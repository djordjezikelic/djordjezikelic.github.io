I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). I joined SMU in January 2024.

Prior to joining SMU, I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2023 at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/) and [Petr Novotn√Ω](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xnovot18/). For my work on developing a framework for learning and verifying neural controllers in stochastic dynamical systems, I received the 2023 **Outstanding Scientific Achievement** award at ISTA together with my colleague Mathias Lechner. Before that, I obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). You can find my CV  [here](CV_Zikelic.pdf).

# Research Interests

My research is concerned with the development of formal verification, synthesis and certified learning techniques towards making software and intelligent systems more safe, robust and trustworthy. To do so, I combine ideas and tackle a range of problems from **Formal Methods**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning** and **Programming Languages** research. 

The central theme of my work are formal verification, synthesis and certified learning techniques for software and intelligent systems in the presence of **uncertainty**. Uncertainty may arise due to a plethora of reasons, including interaction with unknown environments, inference from data, randomization, interleaving of processes or multi-agent systems. My goal is to design methods that take uncertainty into account and allow us to build safe, robust and trustworthy software and intelligent systems even in the presence of uncertainty. My current research interests include:
- Learning-based control and safe reinforcement learning ([NeurIPS23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yx8Sw2H5Q7), [ATVA23](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-45329-8_17), [TACAS23](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30823-9_1), [AAAI23](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26407), [AAAI22](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20695))
