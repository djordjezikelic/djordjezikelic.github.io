I am a fourth year PhD student at IST Austria where I am supervised by [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/). I am also supervised by [Petr Novotn√Ω](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xnovot18/), who is based at the Masaryk University. Prior to coming to IST, I obtained my undergraduate and master degrees in mathematics at the University of Cambridge, where I was a student of the Gonville & Caius College. 

My research focuses on developing algorithms for formally verifying correctness of software. It can be broadly fit into the fields of verification, programming languages and machine learning. I am particularly interested in the following two topics:
1. Program analysis, especially analysis of probabilistic programs.
2. Verification of systems with neural network components.

I also study bidding games. These are a class of graph games that model ongoing and stateful auctions, in which players have budgets and bid for the right to move. In our work, we studied such games with several classical bidding mechanisms.
