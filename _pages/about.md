I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). Previously, I obtained my PhD in 2023 at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/) and [Petr Novotn√Ω](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xnovot18/). For my PhD work, I received the Outstanding PhD Thesis and the Outstanding Scientific Achievement awards at ISTA. Before that, I obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).

You can reach me at dzikelic@smu.edu.sg.

# Research Interests

My research is concerned with helping programmers ensure that software and AI systems are correct, safe, and trustworthy. To achieve this, I study **Formal Methods** and their applications to **Program Analysis and Verification** as well as **Trustworthy AI and Safe Autonomy**. The long-term goal of my work is to advance the theory and automation of formal methods for certifying the correctness of software and AI systems in the presence of **probabilistic uncertainty**, going beyond the classical finite-state probabilistic model checking paradigm. My work is concerned with both theoretical aspects of formal reasoning about probabilistic systems as well as the development of automated methods to help programmers build correct software and AI systems in practice. My current research interests include:
