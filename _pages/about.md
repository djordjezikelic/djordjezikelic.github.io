I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). Previously, I obtained my PhD in 2023 at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/) and [Petr Novotn√Ω](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xnovot18/). For my PhD work, I received the Outstanding PhD Thesis award at ISTA. I also received the Outstanding Scientific Achievement 2023 award at ISTA, together with my collaborator Mathias Lechner, for our work on developing the first framework for certified learning and formal verification of neural controllers in stochastic dynamical systems. Before that, I obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).

# Research Interests

My research is concerned with helping programmers ensure that AI and software systems are correct, safe, and trustworthy. To achieve this, I study **Formal Methods** and their applications to **Trustworthy AI and Safe Autonomy**, as well as **Program Analysis and Verification**. The long term goal of my work is to advance the theory and automation of formal methods for trustworthy AI and software, especially in the presence of **probabilistic uncertainty**. My work is concerned with both theoretical aspects of formal reasoning about probabilistic systems, as well as the development of automated methods to help programmers build correct AI and software systems in practice. My current research interests include:
1. Trustworthy AI and Safe Autonomy

2. Program Analysis and Verification
    - Probabilistic programs ([PLDI24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3656462), [OOPSLA24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3649824), [FAC23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3585391), [CAV22](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_4), [POPL17](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3009837.3009873))
