We are growing a new research group at SMU and have multiple openings for motivated PhD students. Our group also has multiple openings for undergrad research assistantships at SMU, as well as for visiting PhD/master/undergrad students from other institutions. All positions are **fully funded**.

Singapore is a vibrant and cosmopolitan place with a thriving academic landscape. It is also a perfect place for fellow food lovers. SMU is a premier university and provides an excellent research environment with strong groups in formal methods, AI and software engineering. It is ranked No. 13 in the Artificial Intelligence category, No. 4 in the Software Engineering category, and No. 72 worldwide in general "Computer Science" according to [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us) in 2024.

# PhD Positions

I always welcome applications from highly motivated students who wish to pursue a PhD in our group. Our group's research interests are broad and lie at the interplay of Formal Methods, Artificial Intelligence and Programming Languages, where we are interested in both theory and automation aspects. Hence, there is no single ideal candidate profile and we welcome applications from a variety of backgrounds, degrees in computer science, mathematics, software engineering or other related fields. However, an ideal candidate should have a solid background in algorithms/formal methods, probability/statistics as well as prior experience in coding in order to be able to contribute to the research done in our group.

**PhD programme at SMU.** You can find more information about the PhD programme at SMU [here](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/overview).
