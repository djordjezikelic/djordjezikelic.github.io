We are growing a new research group at SMU and have multiple openings for motivated students who wish to join our group. The research agenda of our group is concerned with helping programmers ensure that software and intelligent systems are correct, safe, robust and trustworthy. Our research interests are broad and lie at the interplay of **Formal Methods, Artificial Intelligence and Programming Languages**, with interest in both theory and automation aspects. Hence, we welcome applicants from a broad range of backgrounds. All positions are **fully funded**.

Singapore is a vibrant and cosmopolitan place with a thriving academic landscape. It is also a perfect place for fellow food lovers. SMU is a premier university and provides an excellent research environment with strong groups in formal methods, AI and software engineering. It is ranked No. 13 in the Artificial Intelligence category, No. 4 in the Software Engineering category, and No. 72 worldwide in general "Computer Science" according to [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us) in 2024.

# PhD Positions

I always welcome applications from highly motivated students who wish to pursue a PhD in our group. As our group's research interests are broad, there is no single ideal candidate profile and we welcome applicants from a variety of backgrounds, including those with a degree in computer science, mathematics, software engineering or other related fields. However, an ideal candidate should have a solid background in algorithms/formal methods, probability/statistics as well as prior experience in coding in order to be able to meaningfully contribute to the research done in our group.

**PhD application procedure.** PhD application process at SMU is centralized and all applications should be submitted through our PhD Programme. Please apply via this [link](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/online-application) and list me as a potential advisor. For more information about the PhD programme at SMU, see [here](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/overview). 

**Financial support.** The PhD programme at SMU provides full scholarships together with a monthly stipend for all full-time PhD students on a competitive basis. PhD positions also come with additional funding for conference travel.
